        This is an admin application for kiosks installed in buildings for indoor access control, requested by a company that manufactures robots. Its primary purpose is to manage the information of people who enter the building and to manage the devices. The system was developed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure efficient monitoring of indoor access.

        It was a task that required displaying a large amount of information, such as the status of multiple devices and access data by date and period. To improve readability, the design was made so that not all the information would appear on a single screen. Instead, buttons for date and device selection allow only the desired specific information to be displayed. 

Moreover, to make the information easy and quick to interpret visually, graphs and icons were used. This way, users can grasp important information at a glance before even reading the text.
