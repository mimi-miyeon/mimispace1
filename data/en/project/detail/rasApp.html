        This project is aimed at improving the design and UX of the existing application. 
        While the feel of the app differs from the RAS webpage, I aimed to create a sense of connection by designing pages that provide images and information, 
        as well as emphasizing fonts in a similar style.  
        Black was used as the main color, with teal (the color of the RAS logo) and orange (its complementary color) as accent colors. 
        These two accent colors were used to design the necessary infographic icons.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main services of the application are "Realseller" personal authentication and "Realseller" verified user lookup.

      <p>
        Personal authentication is a method to enhance the trust of registered users. 
        It starts with basic verification such as name, email, and phone number. 
        As users complete additional verifications such as account number, ID card, face authentication, and palm authentication, their trust level increases step by step.
      </p>
      <p>
        To view the 'Realseller' level and personal authentication information of a seller, users can search using the ''Realseller ID'', email, or phone number provided during registration. When meeting in person, the level can be verified through ID card, face recognition, or palm authentication.
