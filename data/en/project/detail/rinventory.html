        "Rinventory" is a name combining "Inventory" and "RealSeller." It is a platform where users can directly upload, manage, and sell their products on 'Wanit', a secondhand phone marketplace.  

Unlike the traditional method of crawling and displaying items listed on other secondhand platforms, Rinventory was created to enable direct product uploads and management on Wanit itself.  

The service primarily consists of essential menus for product management, including the Dashboard, Categories, Product Information, and History pages.

        The Categories section is designed with a folder structure to make product separation and management more convenient.

        The Product Information section allows for detailed entries, including not only basic product details and descriptions but also serial numbers and purchase dates. Additionally, users can customize and modify new templates to suit their preferences.
        (This functionality is also available when creating new categories.)
